| ------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------- |
| 0      | No actual problem to solve                                                                                                    | 0           |
| 1      | Extremely simple and known problem / straight forward solution                                                                | 1 - 2 hours |
| 2      | Simple and known problem / fairly straight forward                                                                            | 2 - 4 hours | 
| 3      | Simple to medium complexity problem / unknown solutions / unknown root cause                                                  | 4 - 8 hours |
| 5      | Medium complexity problem / unknown solution / unknown root cause                                                             | 2 - 3 days  |
| 8      | Medium to very complex problem / unknown solution | unknown root cause                                                        | 1 week      |
| 13     | Very complex problem / solution will be very prevasive / multiple unknowns / large amounts of research needed                 | 2 weeks     |
| 20     | Extremely complex problem / solution will be very pervasive / multiple unknowns / problem really needs to be broken down more | Too large, break it up |
